This Plugin was created to be an addon to LogBlock a minecraft BigBrother alternative.
It has since evolved to allow servers to prevent spawned blocks from spreading.
When you drop a blacklisted block the item is destroyed.
When you access a chest the blacklisted block(s) is(are) removed from your inventory.
When you die the blacklisted blocks are dropped, however only those with the ItemDrop.allow permission can pick it up(or those with op).
A player can not destroy a blacklisted block, only those with the ItemDrop.blockbreak permission can break blocks.
Only those who have the ItemDrop.allow permission can place the offending block.
This plugin has permissions support. The permissions are 
ItemDrop.allow - Allows players to pickup blacklisted blocks and place them
ItemDrop.add - Allows players to add or remove blocks from the black list
ItemDrop.blockbreak - Allows users to break blacklisted blocks
If permissions is not found it defaults to OPs.
Note: If you intend to modify the blocks in the file disable ItemDrop before you do so, otherwise the new entries will be overwritten.
The plugin stores the list of blacklisted blocks in a file ".../plugins/ItemDrop/dblocks.txt"
