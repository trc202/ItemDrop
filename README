This Plugin was created to be an addon to LogBlock a minecraft BigBrother alternative.
This plugin prevents bedrock from making its way into the server and into your players hands.
When you drop bedrock the item is destroyed.
When you access a chest the bedrock is removed from your inventory.
When you die the bedrock is dropped, however only those with the ItemDrop.allow permission can pick it up(or those with op).
Only those who have the ItemDrop.allow permission can place bedrock.
This plugin has permissions support. The only permission is 
ItemDrop.allow - Allows players to pickup bedrock and place it
If permissions is not found it defaults to OPs.
